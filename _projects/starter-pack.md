If you are a lone research software engineer at an institution, it can be daunting thinking about
how to grow your community. This community starter pack provides advice and templates to support bringing together your community of research software engineers (RSEs). This guide includes discussion of what is a research software engineer, how to write a proposal to stress the value
or importance of them, establishing a plan, creating a community portal, and finding other RSEs.
