In early 2019 when <a href="https://us-rse.org" target="_blank">US-RSE</a>
was being established, it was quickly clear that <a href="https://us-rse.org/what-is-an-rse/" target="_blank">
defining a research software engineer</a> would be a challenging task. How could we compare
apples and oranges, when one person might be heavily involved in open source 
software engineering, and another actively publishing, and a third with managerial duties,
and a fourth doing administration for HPC?

RSE Stories is not limited to research software engineers in the United States.
The host @vsoch happens to be located there, but it's important that we share
stories from across the RSE community, regardless of your geographic location.

## Efforts to Define

While a more rigorous analysis would be warranted, there were several early efforts to 
start to discuss the definition of RSE:

 - [Super RSEs](https://danielskatzblog.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/super-rses-combining-research-and-service-in-three-dimensions-of-research-software-engineering/) was a proposal that hypothesized three dimensions for RSEs.
 - [The Story of the Research Software Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trAfA9VWLTQ) presented the question as a story, and discussed <a href="https://vsoch.github.io/2019/the-research-software-engineer/#what-is-an-rse" target="_blank">different types of RSEs</a>
 - [The RSE Phenotype Generator](https://us-rse.org/rse-phenotype/) took the stance that the best way to define RSE was to ask people directly, and have them define any number of dimensions and communities served.
 - [The USRSE Blog](https://us-rse.org/blog/) can take similar initiative by presenting the work of a small set of self-selected RSEs.
 - [Why Research Software Engineers](http://urssi.us/blog/2019/04/16/why-research-software-engineers/) touched on the topic by describing the need for RSEs.

## A Limited Scope

Do you see the issue with any of the above links? The challenge is that they come from
a single (or small number) of perspectives. In fact, the most compelling definitions for 
what encompasses a research software engineer must come from the community itself.
For this reason, we've created this podcast series to tell the stories of the hidden faces
of research software engineering.

## How do I get involved?

There are many ways to get involved, and because of the time committments for just a few
folks to run a podcast, even the tiniest of contributions is hugely appreciated!

 - **be a guest on the show**: If you are interested in being interviewed for our show, please [sign up](https://forms.gle/8NBVQYwTgDs4X7HN7) to be interviewed! It requires no preparation, and is low key and relaxed.
 - **be an editor**: While the hosts are happy to do most editing, if you've ever edited audio before, you know this is a very time consuming task. Even if you can only offer to edit one episode a year, this is hugely helpful! 
 - **be a host**: Have you ever wanted to try interviewing someone? Or maybe recording an episode on a special topic of interest? Whether you want to host just once, once a month, or more regularly, anyone in the rseng community is offered this opportunity. If you are interested, please reach out to [@vsoch](https://github.com/vsoch) to start discussion.
