## What is the RSE Manifesto?

If you're an RSE, what general standards do you (consciously or unconsciously) use
to guide your daily interactions and life? These are the points, some serious, 
and some funny, that research software engineers live by. You may not agree
with all of them, but likely you can relate to some degree, or understand where
your fellow RSE is coming from. Being a research
software engineer can be hard, and we should share the rules that we use to govern
our daily roles, and strive to not take ourselves too seriously!
