# Research Software Engineers

Welcome to the Research Software Engineer's GitHub Organization! We are an open
community of developers that would like to cross institutional and geographic
boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. As we are setting up,
this site will serve as a catalog for some of our projects.

Here is an example:
