# Research Software Engineer Phenotype Generator

It wouldn't be right to say that an RSE must fall within a strict set of categories, or dimensions. Nor
would it be correct to assume that all RSEs serve the same user communities. This is the reason that
this tool exists - with the RSE Phenotype generator <strong>you</strong> are the one that gets
to decide the dimensions that are relevant to you (open source and research? high performance computing and software
engineering? Documentation and testing? Something else?) along with the communities that you serve, for which you
could provide a score for each dimension.
