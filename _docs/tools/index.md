# Tools

Here we've provided a set of tools to help you assess your tools, and ask for support!

 - [Software Checklist](software-checklist/) What makes a reproducible software repository? Complete our checklist to find out how well you measure up. This will be converted into a tool to generate a badge. [[ref](https://vsoch.github.io/2019/software-checklist/)]

More tools are under development and will be shared soon!
