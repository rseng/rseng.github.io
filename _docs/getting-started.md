Whether you strong associate with the role, want to hire a research software engineer,
or be an advocate, you might enjoy the resources on this site. If you are looking

that an RSE can offer!

{% include alert.html type="tip" title="Did you know that..." content="A research software engineer can do much more than work on research software. RSEs have domain knowledge, and can write manuscripts alongside software, or content for a Methods section for the work you are conducting." %}

## Projects

You can learn about or contribute to some research software engineer oriented [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
