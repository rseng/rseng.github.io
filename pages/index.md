# Research Software Engineers

Welcome to the Research Software Engineer's GitHub Organization! We are an open
community of developers that would like to cross institutional and geographic
boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. This site serves as
a catalog for some of our projects, template, and learning
materials.

{% include alert.html title="What is a research software engineer?" type="info" content="Did you know that research software engineers include everyone from programmers, to doing programming for research? Whether you are a full time software engineer, a researcher that does a ton of programming, or an advocate for the role, if you care about research software, you have a place in this community." %}
