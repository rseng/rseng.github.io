# About

RSENG is a GitHub Organization for the global research software engineering community.

## Background

Research is becoming increasingly more about having skills and expertise that go well beyond a particular domain of knowledge. To be a successful research scientist, not only do you need this domain expertise, but you also need to know statistics, how to ask and answer scientific questions, and datasets and methods to do so. But expertise and data is not enough. With the increasing demand for using computational resources and scientific programming, practices from software engineering and high performance computing (HPC) have become standard practice in research today.

While having an understanding of these practices is an important part of the learning experience for some, the implementation of software and scaled machine learning pipelines can be a burden for others. Further, reproducibility and maintenance of code suffers in the long run when scientists move on to a new project or position. To address this need to support our software, the role of a research software engineer has been growing in awareness over the last decade. For
example, we now have RSE communities for several nations:

 - [usrse](https://us-rse.org/)
 - [uk-rse](https://society-rse.org/)
 - [nl-rse](https://nl-rse.org/)

## The RSENG GitHub Organization

In support of these country-based organizations, this rseng GitHub Organization was created
as a location agnostic set of projects and resources for anyone in the global rseng community
that wants to work together. You are encouraged to add your own project, join the rseng GitHub Organization,
and help with existing initatives. If we work together and have fun, not only will 
open science will benefit, but we will better enjoy our careers and lives.
